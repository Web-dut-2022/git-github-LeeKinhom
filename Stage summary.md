I have learned considerable acknowledge about HTML since I took part in this course. At the same time, I studied how to use Github which I barely used before. Though I am not very versed in it now, I deeply believe that I will reach the summit if I stick it out. I do hope I can learn more pragmatic acknowledge that can be applied to the daily parctical problem from this course.
